  - Facilitating data transfer between hardware and CPU/memory.
- **Key Concepts**:
  - Device management in operating systems.
  - I/O system architecture.

## Slide 2: Architecture of I/O Systems
- **Key Components**:
  - **System Bus**: Shared communication path for devices to interact with the CPU.
  - **Device Port**:
    - **Registers**:
      - Status: Device readiness/errors.

# I/O Module and Tasks

## Slide 7: I/O Module (Controller)
- **Role**: Acts as intermediary between peripherals and the system bus.
- **Functions**:
  - Manages data rate mismatches.
  - Provides a standard interface for CPU communication.

## Slide 8: External Interface
- **Types of Connections**:
  - **Parallel Transmission**:
    - Fast but expensive.
    - Best for local transfers.
  - **Serial Transmission**:
    - Slower but cost-effective.
    - Suitable for long distances.

## Slide 9: I/O Module Tasks
- **Core Tasks**:
  - **Control & Timing**: Synchronizes CPU and device operations.
  - **Data Buffering**: Smoothens transfer rates.
  - **Error Detection**: Ensures data integrity.
  - **Decision Making**: Determines device properties and methods.

## Slide 10: I/O Module Features
- **Capabilities**:

# Communication Methods

## Slides 11–13: Programmed I/O (Polling)
- **Process**:
  - CPU checks device status repeatedly.
- **Drawbacks**:
  - Wastes CPU time waiting for slower devices.
- **Best Use**:
  - Systems with limited peripherals or low efficiency requirements.

## Slide 14: Addressing I/O Devices
- **Methods**:
  - **Memory-Mapped I/O**: Shared address space for memory and devices.
  - **Isolated I/O**: Separate address spaces, requiring special instructions.

## Slides 15–17: Interrupts
- **Purpose**: Notify CPU of an event.
- **Examples**: Program errors, timers, I/O operations, hardware failures.
- **Process**:
  - Save current program state.
  - Execute interrupt service routine (ISR).
  - Resume original program.

# Efficiency Improvements

## Slides 18–22: Interrupt-Driven I/O
- **Advantages**:
  - CPU handles other tasks while waiting for I/O module.
  - Devices signal CPU only when ready.

## Slides 23–25: Multiple Interrupts
- **Techniques**:
  - **Disabling Interrupts**: Processes one interrupt at a time.
  - **Priority Handling**: Processes high-priority interrupts first.

## Slides 26–31: Direct Memory Access (DMA)
- **Purpose**: Transfers data directly between devices and memory.
- **Steps**:
  - CPU sets up DMA controller with device and memory details.
  - DMA handles the transfer independently.
  - CPU resumes work once DMA completes.
- **Benefits**:
  - Reduces CPU overhead.
  - Speeds up data transfer.
