Based on the lecture material provided, I'll create a few practice questions related to databases and database management systems. Let me know if you're ready to start practicing!

Here's a question to get started:

**Question 1:**
What are the main disadvantages of traditional file processing systems compared to database management systems (DBMS)?

No problem! Letâ€™s work through some more questions together. Here are a few more questions related to the course material:

1. **What is a Database Management System (DBMS) and why is it important in managing data for businesses and organizations?**
2. **Explain the difference between structured and unstructured data. Can you give an example of each type?**
3. **What is metadata, and why is it important in a database system?**
4. **Describe the hierarchy of data from the smallest unit to the largest. What role does each level play?**



Based on the content from the document "Lecture 2 - Database System and Database Design," here are 10 multiple-choice questions related to databases and DBMS with answers and explanations:

b) High costs for hardware and software
c) Accurate and reliable data
d) Ability to share data easily among multiple users

---

## **Answer Key with Explanations**

### **Question 1:**

**Correct Answer:** a) Increased data redundancy

- **Explanation:** Traditional file-based systems suffer from increased data redundancy because the same data may be stored in multiple files, leading to inconsistency and duplication.

---

### **Question 2:**

**Correct Answer:** c) Hierarchical model

- **Explanation:** The hierarchical model organizes records in a tree-like structure, with parent-child relationships. Each child can have only one parent.

---

### **Question 3:**

**Correct Answer:** c) As two-dimensional tables

- **Explanation:** In the relational model, data is represented in tables (or relations) with rows (records) and columns (fields).

---

### **Question 4:**

**Correct Answer:** b) Describing the data stored in the database and the relationships between data

- **Explanation:** The conceptual level in DBMS architecture is responsible for defining the logical structure of the database and the relationships among data.

---

### **Question 5:**

**Correct Answer:** c) Improves personal productivity by allowing a single user to manage data

- **Explanation:** Personal databases are typically used by a single user to manage data locally, improving personal productivity.

---

### **Question 6:**

**Correct Answer:** b) To store and manage data while the client application accesses it over the network

- **Explanation:** In a two-tier architecture, the server stores and manages the data, while the client (application) accesses the data over a network.

---

### **Question 7:**

**Correct Answer:** c) Better management and scalability through separate tiers

- **Explanation:** N-tier architecture allows for better scalability and management by separating the different layers (client, application, and database servers), which can be managed independently.

---

### **Question 8:**

**Correct Answer:** b) To integrate data from multiple sources for decision support

- **Explanation:** Data warehouses store large amounts of integrated data from multiple sources and are used for decision support and analytics rather than daily operations.

---

### **Question 9:**

**Correct Answer:** b) Field, record, file, database

- **Explanation:** The correct hierarchy of data is field (smallest unit), record (collection of fields), file (collection of records), and database (collection of files).

---

### **Question 10:**

**Correct Answer:** b) High costs for hardware and software

- **Explanation:** While DBMS offers many advantages like data consistency and ease of data sharing, it also comes with high costs for hardware, software, and maintenance.
