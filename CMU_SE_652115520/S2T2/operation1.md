### **Multiple-Choice Questions**
1. **Which of the following is NOT a type of user interface provided by operating systems?**  
   **Your Answer: C (Voice Recognition Interface)**  
   **Correct Answer: C**  
   *Explanation:* Voice recognition is not a standard interface provided by operating systems. CLI, GUI, and touchscreen interfaces are common.

2. **What is the main purpose of resource allocation in an operating system?**  
   **Your Answer: B (To distribute system resources among multiple users or tasks)**  
   **Correct Answer: B**  
   *Explanation:* Resource allocation ensures system resources like CPU, memory, and I/O devices are distributed efficiently.

3. **Which parameter passing method uses memory blocks for system calls?**  
   **Your Answer: C (Memory Block)**  
   **Correct Answer: C**  
   *Explanation:* Parameters are stored in a memory block, and the block's address is passed to the OS.

4. **Which type of system call is responsible for opening, closing, and managing files?**  
   **Your Answer: B (File Management)**  
   **Correct Answer: B**  
   *Explanation:* File management system calls handle file operations such as opening, reading, and deleting files.

5. **Which of the following is an advantage of a microkernel?**  
   **Your Answer: B (Easier to extend)**  
   **Correct Answer: B**  
   *Explanation:* Microkernels have minimal kernel functions, making it easier to extend or modify features.

### **Short Answer Questions**
Letâ€™s evaluate your answers:

1. **Main differences between monolithic and layered structures:**  
   - A **monolithic structure** integrates all OS functions in a single level, leading to better performance but reduced modularity.
   - A **layered structure** organizes the OS into hierarchical layers, improving modularity and maintainability at the cost of performance.

2. **Role of APIs in system calls and examples:**  
   - APIs provide an interface for applications to interact with the OS without needing to know implementation details. Examples include Win32 API, POSIX API, and Java API.

3. **How hybrid OS combines features:**  
   - Hybrid systems combine monolithic, microkernel, and modular designs for balance.  
   - Examples:  
     - **macOS:** Combines microkernel (Mach) with BSD UNIX.  
     - **Android:** Uses Linux kernel with a runtime environment (Dalvik VM).
